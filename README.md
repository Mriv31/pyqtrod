# PyQtRod

Software for visualization and analysis of rod data


## Clone the GIT directory 

Create an account on Gitlab physics just by connecting once to [Gitlab Physics](https://gitlab.physics.ox.ac.uk/) with your Physics credential.

Install [Git for windows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Clone the repository from the command line.

```
cd where_you_want_to_put_the_software
git clone https://gitlab.physics.ox.ac.uk/rieu/PyQtRod.git
```

You will be asked to enter your physics credential. If there are any access problem, ask me and I will add permission for you to clone.

##Â Update the GIT directory

To update any modification I will have made to the software, just enter from the command line :

```
cd where_you_want_to_put_the_software/PyQtRod
git pull
```

## Install Python

To run the software you will need a Python environment. Check what is available on physics self service or install [Python 3.10 for windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html). 

I recommend not to use the Anaconda environment](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/), since most recent modules will be harder to install. 

##Install Python modules

Several Python modules are needed to run the software. To do so open a command line console and enter : 

```
cd where_you_want_to_put_the_software/PyQtRod
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run PyQtRod

```
cd where_you_want_to_put_the_software/PyQtRod
python3 PyQtRod.py
```

## Install Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab for interactive data treatment
Execute from command-line : 
```
pip install notebook
```
or, for Jupyter Lab,

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

## Launching jupyter notebook:
```
python -m notebook
```

or, for jupyterlab
```
python -m jupyterlab
```

You can find an example of jupyter notebook with treatment of tdms data in Examples.
